MEND aims to provide a simple interface for encryption of sensitive information such as text or files to a location 
on your local machine.

After a small amount of setup, you can use mend to encrypt and decrypt text and files with simple and short commands.
You only need to remember one password to unlock mend which will then allow you to decrypt the files.
